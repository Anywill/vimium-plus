* a Chrome extension that provides keyboard-based navigation and control
    of the web in the spirit of the Vim editor.
* from [philc/vimium:master](https://github.com/philc/vimium).
* optimized after translating it from CoffeeScript into JavaScript.
* more functions, more powerful, and more convenient (for me, at least).

Release Notes
-------------

1.54:
* **WARNING**: change modifier keys' order into `m-c-a-` (breaking)
* add `LinkHints.activateModeToEdit` to select an editable area with hints
* deprecate `clearGlobalMarks` and please use `Marks.clearGlobal` instead
* rework `goUp` and `goToRoot`: try to support different forms of hash bangs
* use `event.key` if it exists, to disable warning on Chrome 52
* the default `tinyMemory` is set `true`,
  and the history completer loads slower but has a smaller memory peak
* Chrome 52 doesn't allow Vimium to create an incognito window
    using a normal tab,
  so those tricks which allow Vimium++ to show normal tabs in incognito windows
    won't work any more.
  Also fix a bug that `createTab` may not work properly on a popup window.
* lots of bug fixes
* add a branch `basic-on-edge` to make Vimium++ work on Microsoft Edge,
    although many commands become broken after the migration
* rename front-end global variables to `V***`,
  in order to avoid potential name collisions when injected into other hosts

1.53.1:

* Link hints: filter out those only having one single clickable child
* use a better and more compatible way to get a bookmark's full path
* replace setting item `UILanguage` with simpler `localeEncoding`
* auto load bookmarks if `tinyMemory` is disabled, so Vomnibar's first complement is faster
* bug fixes:
  * fail to get a bookmark's full path
  * fail to decode urls by given character encoding
  * a potential crash in history completer

1.53 includes many improvements about memory, speed and functionalities.
